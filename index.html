				<h1>Hi! I'm Miguel Matos, a <strong>Personal Trainer</strong></h1>
				<hr class="sep-2" />
				<p>I care deeply about my clients, and there's nothing of more value to me than helping somebody go through an experience that makes them happy, 
					confident, and strong. I realize how being overweight affects many aspects of your life, and I want to be there for you and help you discover the benefits and joys of training that helped me become the person I am today.
					 I'm here to be your personal guide on every step of the journey.
					 <p>  When I first began my adventure with fitness I was anything but the picture of health. I was very overweight and I realized it was because of eating fast food and drinking pop and beer on a regular basis. I decided to do something about it. I immersed myself in a new lifestyle and have never regretted it. </p>
                    <br>
					 <p>  I did, however, have multiple ups and downs. It took me years to make a decision to thoroughly examine my workouts and make necessary changes.</p>
					 <br>
					 <p>  Learning about the benefits of Metabolic Training and HIIT entirely transformed my body. What I enjoy the most about it is that there is minimal or even NO equipment required and you can do it anytime and anywhere. </p>
					</p>
