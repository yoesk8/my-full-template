				<h1>Hi! I'm Miguel Matos, a <strong>Personal Trainer</strong></h1>
				<hr class="sep-2" />
				<p>I care deeply about my clients, and there's nothing of more value to me than helping somebody go through an experience that makes them happy, 
					confident, and strong. I realize how being overweight affects many aspects of your life, and I want to be there for you and help you discover the benefits and joys of training that helped me become the person I am today.
					 I'm here to be your personal guide on every step of the journey.
					 <p>  When I first began my adventure with fitness I was anything but the picture of health. I was very overweight and I realized it was because of eating fast food and drinking pop and beer on a regular basis. I decided to do something about it. I immersed myself in a new lifestyle and have never regretted it. </p>
                    <br>
					 <p>  I did, however, have multiple ups and downs. It took me years to make a decision to thoroughly examine my workouts and make necessary changes.</p>
					 <br>
					 <p>  Learning about the benefits of Metabolic Training and HIIT entirely transformed my body. What I enjoy the most about it is that there is minimal or even NO equipment required and you can do it anytime and anywhere. </p>

						<p> 
							I've never been one of those people who loves the gym or looks forward to exercise, 
							ill openly admit that I just don't have to self-discipline or self-motivation.
							 Since being a client of MM Personal Training, I've loved training,
							  the most important thing of the whole experience is that it's fun and I look forward 
							  to every session as no two sessions are ever the same. Since I started training with MM Personal training, 
							  I've lost 3 stone, gained a level of fitness I never thought possible and have increased my self-confidence

							Miguel is a PT that I recommend to all my friends and family. He has ample experience and it clear shows.
He has helped me lose weight and I have also enjoyed it too.
He gave me a personalised eat plan to assist me with my weight loss goal!!

						<p>Former Client</p>
						<p> 
							I have spent most of my adult life the same size and shape and making the same mistakes with fad diets. 
							Only once I joined MM Personal training have I changed my mindset, my diet and have lost a lot of weight.
							 Simple and effective! You cannot slip through the cracks with Dee - he will hold you accountable!
