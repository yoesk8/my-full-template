## Issues found during site development

* #### Horizontal scrolling bar on the bottom of the screen.
![testing_issue_1](testing/testing_issue_1.png)

I used [grid markup](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/#header-and-footer)
to create two sepereate collumns. To achieve this I had to use *.row* in first *div* element and *.col-sm-6* in the second *div* element.
After that I found that horizontal scrolling bar appear on the bottom of the screen.
Using mozilla developer tools I noticed that by default class *.row* has *margin-right: -15px;* and *margin-left: -15px;*

To fix this I created new class *.no-row-margin* and set both margins to 0px.

> After I gain more experience with bootstrap I found that I could achive this by [no-gutters](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/#no-gutters) class.

> I read bootstrap documentation about [Spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/spacing/) and I decided to use predefined classes for paddings and margins in the project.
By doing this I think my code looks cleaner and will be easier to understand by other developers.


* #### Ipad screen compatibility

I found a bugs on Ipad screens. I would like to keep years dates just above the stars, but they were shifted.

![testing_issue_2](testing/testing_ipad_screen.png)

I had to create a block element with a class "ipad-screen" and non-breaking space element inside a block element.
In CSS file I had to create @media rule that will show this block element on Ipad displays only.

>}
@media screen and (max-width: 991px) and (min-width: 0px),(min-width:1200px){
    .ipad-screen {
    display: none;
}
}

![bug_solutino2](testing/bug_solution2.png)

## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
I had to do couple of changes to improve performance. Screenshots are presented below:

![bug_performance1](testing/performance1.png)
![bug_performance2](testing/performance2.png)

Final results:
![performance_final](testing/performance_final.png)
I noticed that this tests scores vary from time to time and depends on external libraries as well. 



## Code Validation
 At the and of the project I used two websites to validate a code
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS
 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
